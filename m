Many reporters of bugs found using AI do not follow the instructions to
treat them as public, likely because they're worried to be blamed for
disclosing it.

The security team constantly receives duplicate reports within a very
short time, which makes it clear that when an LLM finds a bug, others
find it at the same time, and some may already be working on exploiting
it. Keeping it private then protects nobody, while handling it publicly
lets everyone fix it quickly without a needless embargo.

Let's clarify these points and also reword a sentence about AI reports
that could be read as "do not send them to us".

 Use common sense when evaluating the report. If the affected file has not been
