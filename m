From my memory of the discussions:

- If a specific LLM turns out to be in a bad position with regard to
  some copyright ruling, we can identify the commits that might have
  been tainted by it.

- Similarly should an LLM prove to have an inclination toward specific
  types of security issues.

Whether either of these would ever actually prove useful is not
something I can hazard a guess for.

The widespread ignoring of the disclosure rule is, IMO, something we
need to address somehow; were I still on the TAB, I'd be raising the
issue there.  Either we find a way to be serious about enforcing the
disclosure rule, or we should just drop it.  A rule that everybody
ignores is less than useful.

(That said, 706 commits in 7.2-rc1 include Assisted-by tags, so *some*
people are complying.  That's about 5% of the total.  What do we think
is the actual use of LLMs for the creation of kernel patches?)
