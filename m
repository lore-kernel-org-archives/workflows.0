Most fixes accompanying security reports cannot be applied with git am,
either because they were damaged by the mailer, or because they just
lack a commit message, and the vast majority of our responses to
reporters are about the patch format. The doc only said to format the
fix "in a way that can be immediately merged", but by now it has
become clear that for many reporters it doesn't have the same meaning
as for maintainers.

Let's give concrete methods: preferably the report as the cover letter
of the series produced by git format-patch, then the fix sent as a reply
to the report, and as a last resort the patch attached, with a warning
that some maintainers won't look at it. Let's also explain how to deal
with public patches and private reports.

+Sending a fix
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Most fixes sent along with reports cannot be applied as-is, because they were
+damaged by the mailer or lacking a commit message, forcing maintainers to ask
+for a resend. A fix must be applicable using ``git am``, which is most easily
+achieved by letting git produce and send the messages (see
+Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst).
+
+When the fix is meant to only be sent privately, the preferred method is to
+send the report as a cover letter of a series, followed by the fix::
+
+  $ git format-patch --cover-letter -1
+  (edit 0000-cover-letter.patch and replace the subject and text with the
+   report's subject and text)
+  $ git send-email --suppress-cc=all --to=<maintainers> 000*.patch
+
+The recipients are those determined above (add ``--cc=`` for the security team
+when needed). The ``--suppress-cc=all`` option is important: without it,
+``git send-email`` also sends the messages to addresses found in the patch's
+tags (e.g. ``Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org``), which would leak the report to a
+public list.
+
+If the report was already sent, the fix may be sent as a reply to it, to the
+same recipients, for example using ``git send-email --suppress-cc=all
+--in-reply-to=<report's Message-ID>``. As a last resort, when none of these
+methods is possible, the file produced by ``git format-patch`` may be attached
+as-is to the report, but be aware that some maintainers will not look at
+attachments. However, never attach more than one patch per message without
+being explicitly invited to so, as this would significantly complicate reviews.
+
+When the fix is meant to be public (e.g. for bugs found using AI-based tools,
+see above), send it using ``git send-email`` to the maintainers and lists
+reported by get_maintainer.pl (i.e. without the ``--no-l`` option), with a
+commit message that does not detail how to exploit the bug. Then send the
+report and the reproducer privately to the maintainers (and to the security
+team when needed), mentioning the patch's Message-ID or its link on
+https://lore.kernel.org/ so that they can be matched. The report may also be
+sent as a reply to the public message, after carefully removing all public
+addresses from the To: and Cc: fields.
