Maintainers should be free to ignore what they perceive as slop without needing
to defend that call. Reputation can be gained by submitting useful work or
being present in the community, attending conferences, giving talks, etc.
I am not saying that we should be harsh on beginning contributors (or I would
have to count myself out as well), but they should be as free as possible to
only invest their time in the project and people that may become involved in the
community. And that call is up to them.

I try to review fix-up patches of first-time contributors, but if it reeks of
AI I don't bother. We have the same policy in the kernel mentorship program,
we invest time to help people get involved with the community and kernel, not
to let someone strike "kernel contributor" of their list. The whole point is
not that most of this clean-up work is super useful (and indeed an LLM can do it),
but to let someone feel excited about contributing and maybe getting them to
to stick around.
