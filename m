Perhaps, but I think that's missing the point. The SoB line is not
enforceable either. Very few of our requirements and assumptions can be
enforced. We're not telling people they can get backdoors merged in the
kernel because we can't guarantee 100% that one won't sneak in.

What this is about is setting our expectations, telling what we want and
what we don't want. There's still value in that, and I'd argue there's
even more value now. There will be people who won't care, there will be
people who cheat. We've always had those, we'll keep having them, and
we'll keep rejecting their contributions. I really don't get the
unenforceable argument here.

What would be your issue with writing commit messages manually ?

Again, we're not aiming for 100% accuracy, we've never considered that
goal reachable, LLMs or not.
