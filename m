The rules indicating when to Cc the security team were a bit confusing,
because "Identifying contacts" said to always Cc it, while the details
said it was only needed for small teams or for the first few reports,
and nothing said what to do when the impact is unclear or when posting
to a public list.

Let's try to clarify this a little bit now that the rules have evolved
a few times, while not changing what already works fine nor from what
is being properly practiced. It also clarifies the "within a week" by
insisting not to ask before that delay.

This patch changes the unconditional Cc at the top to "when needed, see
below", and groups all cases in a single list that's easier to verify
for the reporter.

+The report must be sent to maintainers.  You must also Cc: the Linux kernel
+security team in any of the following cases:
+
+  * it is your first report: many first reports are incomplete, too long, too
+    strong, difficult to handle, and put a lot of pressure on maintainers. The

+    this impact, and you will need to share any information you have;
+
+  * you are seeking specific help, such as when resending a message which got
+    no response within a week (and please do not ask for feedback before such
+    a delay, some subsystems have a long report queue, and some maintainers can
+    only read them on spare time).
+
+In other cases, i.e. when a report of clear impact is sent to a larger
+team of clearly identified maintainers, it is not necessary to Cc: the
+security list.  Never Cc: the security list on a message sent to a public
+list.

 The Linux kernel security team can be contacted by email at
 <security@kernel.org>.  This is a private list of security officers
 who will help verify the bug report and assist developers working on a fix.
