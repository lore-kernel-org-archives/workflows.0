Subject: [PATCH] docs: process: use gender-neutral pronouns
Date: Thu, 10 Sep 2026 00:41:00 +1000

Several process documents use gendered pronouns when referring
generically to developers and maintainers. Use singular they instead,
making the language inclusive without changing its meaning.

Leave pronouns referring to named people and text in attributed
quotations unchanged.
