I think 3-7 don't need the tag.

I think this doesn't need the tag, too.  Like patches, the user should
completely reviewed and understand the text, though.  Without the complete
review, it should not be submmitted at all, regardless of the tag.

I'm not very sure...  I don't really feel the question is that difficult and
ambiguous to answer.  I may be biased.
