Kind words always make a difference :) so thank you. And agreed, I am
working on... working less :P

I take my maintainership duties seriously, so there's always stuff I _have_
to do, though. I suppose the point is that for me and likely many others,
things are _already_ overloaded.

I have a fair bit of experience on this front, as I did a lot of work
establishing mm maintainers/reviewers once the community had decided on
establishing submaintainers, etc.

Aside from being technically competent, maintainers must have 'soft' skills
(misnomer, they are the most important), need sufficient experience to do
the job, importantly must be able to say 'no' (when taste or technical
concern dictates), and must also be willing to put up with what it entails
(now including slop).

That filters it down to a very small number of people, unfortunately, and
in any case even if we had hordes of maintainers, the number of people
sending slop can always exponentially exceed them.

On reviewers and reviewing I agree, but it is _really_ hard to get people
to review more, and I've noticed the slop has clearly discouraged people
from doing more.

That's not what I'm saying, at least, myself :)

With the best will in the world if we start getting 500 mails a day, or
1,000, or 10,000, even reading the mail becomes intractable.

Again, to me, it's just a scaling issue - nobody can read hundreds or
thousands of mails a day effectively, and maintainers and reviewers are
past capacity even now.

And agreed, we need talented young people coming up and it kills me that
they might be discouraged both by 'AI will take over so what's the point'
and the hordes of 'competing' people sending slop.

Perhaps there are ways and means of getting talented new people involved
via side-channel, though.

I did the 'eudyptula challenge' many years ago, which was a sort of boot
camp for kernel developers (with a lot of 'are you patient enough' bits :)

That can't work in identical form anymore because of AI (sigh), but perhaps
we can figure out some AI-proof version of this?

You're welcome! Thanks for your kind and thoughtful response.

And yes, text sucks, and I have myself both communicated poorly and
misinterpreted people via email more times than I'd care to admit... :)

It does seem text, while useful for asynchronous comms, is often very poor
at conveying tone and intent.

The intent of what I said was to be totally honest, and to _own_ the
'collateral damage', rather than to deny that, which felt, to me,
dishonest.

Perhaps I could have conveyed that better, but that was the intent at
least! :)

I'm sure the other maintainers who've said similar things feel the same
way.

None of us are enjoying this I wouldn't say, and none of us want to harm
genuine newcomers.

So yeah, the TL;DR is 'scaling is the big problem' and I probably should
have limited my response to that many mails ago :)
