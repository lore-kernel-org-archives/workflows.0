b4 can already handle that if the dependencies are listed.

b4 can handle that too as long as all the patches are in lore.

That would be nice as it shifts the whole problem of applying a series 
to the submitter. 

However, I think there would be new issues. The base could be old or a 
stable tree. The base could contain a commit to disable all those 
annoying warnings or disable all the failing tests which then affects 
any testing we run on the series. But all of that is probably much more 
rare than the number of series that don't apply today.
