Your messages got completely ignored for a month and a half. Most
developers (including myself) don't read LKML due to the high traffic,
but I'm still surprised by the complete lack of reply. Maybe CC'ing the
workflows@vger.kernel.org mailing list would have helped ?

That's absolutely right, and I would welcome that outcome. At this point
I don't think I'm talking for the majority though :-)
