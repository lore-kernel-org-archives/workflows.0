That's the point I raised during the maintainer summit. It's actually
the *absence* of a tag that helps me push back on review. It allows me
to ask submitters if they forgot to add the tag, and in many cases (so
far) they simply don't reply.

I'm not happy removing the tag without adding another mechanism for
required disclosure. Without that, I can foresee submitters pushing back
on the question.

I agree that, for my use cases, recording the tag in the git log isn't
useful. We discussed the option of requiring it in the cover letter or
below the scissors line. That would be my preference, but few people
expressed support for it.
