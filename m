Yup I couldn't disagree more with Christian here, the whole thing feels like
trying to 'wish away' the AI issue, and now punting off to subsystem
maintainers...

Subsystems impact each other. Right now I'm writing a series that changes driver
code so we can enforce some sanity in mm APIs.

I've had to interact with fs code quite a bit that uses mm logic.

It's all interconnected, and one subsystem let's say going with 'let it all in'
say, impacts another.

Yes some people lie about it, but having the guidelines only STRENGTHENS our
position on that, and I've seen that in practice.

So yeah, sorry, I think it's beyond silly to push back on requesting somebody
disclose how much of a patch/series was AI generated.

And [0] already essentially says people NEED to do this now. But that doc has
been rather downplayed unfortunately I think.

Again, asking LLM submitters to write a single comment is 'beaurocracy'?

I disagree, I think it's important to have it standardised and simple.

If we make things vague, people won't do it. And reading through a cover letter
in its AI slop entirety (and boy does it generate a LOT of text) to find the
mention or not (and hey what if it's not clear?) is just objectively worse.

For me it's about empowering maintainers to push back.

Not sure about that, if it turns out AI-generated patches are causing 95% more
bugs say that's pretty useful information no?

Or if you find that a patch somebody sent from another subsystem that has a
lassez faire approach to AI slop completely breaks you in some subtle way, isn't
it easier to push for a revert if you see it's LLM-generated?

And is it really that egregious to include a tag? You can ignore it if you don't
care.
