Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/3] MAINTAINERS: Introduce V: field for required tests
Date:   Wed, 15 Nov 2023 19:43:48 +0200

The idea of this RFC is to introduce a way to catalogue and document any tests
that should be executed for changes to a subsystem, as well as to make
checkpatch.pl require a tag in commit messages certifying they were, plus
hopefully make it easier to discover and run them.

This is following a discussion Veronika Kabatova started with a few
(addressed) people at the LPC last year (IIRC), where there was a good deal of
interest for something like this.

Apart from implementing basic support (surely to be improved), two sample
changes are added on top, adding a few test suites (roughly) based on what the
maintainers described earlier. I'm definitely not qualified for describing
them adequately, and don't have the time to dig deeper, but hopefully they
could serve as illustrations, and shouldn't be merged as is.

I would defer to maintainers of the corresponding subsystems and tests to
describe their tests and requirements better. Although I would accept
amendments too, if they prefer it that way.

One bug I know that's definitely there is handling removed files. The
scripts/get_maintainer.pl chokes on non-existing files, failing to output the
required test suites (I'm sure there's a good reason, but I couldn't see it).
My first idea is to only check for required tests upon encountering the '+++
<file>' line, and ignore the '/dev/null' file, but I hope the checkpatch.pl
maintainers could recommend a better way.

Anyway, tell me what you think, and I'll work on polishing this.

Thank you!
Nick
