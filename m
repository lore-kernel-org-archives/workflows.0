If cloning git repos is too much work, You can subscribe to an
Atom feed of search results to paths or files you're interested
in using "dfn:" (diff-file-name) using your favorite feed
reader:

lore.kernel.org/lkml/?q=dfn:path/to/dir-or-file-youre-interested-in&x=A

Or drop the "&x=A" to get an HTML summary, or POST to that URL
with "&x=m" to download an mbox.

You can also search for multiple files at once by having dfn:foo
multiple times separated by "OR"

lore.kernel.org/lkml/?q=dfn:foo+OR+dfn:bar&x=A

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/_/text/help/ has other prefixes
like "dfn:" which might be helpful for search.

For example, if you expected to be Cc-ed (or To-ed) and want to
double-check that your mail account got it, you can use the "c:"
or "tc:" prefixes with your name or address, too.
