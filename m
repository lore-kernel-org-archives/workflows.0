Well I prefer a tag for reasons below. I'm fine with non-advertising yeah.

Yeah, again I could live without it being in the tree. I think there's some
advantages though.

See below for tag argument.

It seems we are more in agreement than it seems :)

I prefer a tag as it's clear cut and easily greppable and easily noticeable.

If it's words it can be vague or be unclear or inconsistent and you might miss
etc.

So I have a strong preference for a tag, would love to add details about how
much LLM done (that'll be vague obviously + have grey lines).

I agree gettig rid of model is worthwhile but I'm not bothered if we don't do
that.

Thanks, Lorenzo
