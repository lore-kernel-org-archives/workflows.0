We need this code to be maintained, because as is being shown, there are
reported problems with it that will affect these devices/networks that
you all are using.  So all we need is a maintainer for this to be able
to take reports that we get and fix things up as needed.  I know you
have that experience, want to come back to kernel development, we've
missed you :)
