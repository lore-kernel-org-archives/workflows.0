Thanks for both of these -- it does seem simpler to me this way, which
is what I expected.

If we are going to have a skill for the stable bit and you are updating
the list, then may we take the chance to include Rust soundness issue?
Please see below.

Thanks!

Cheers,
Miguel

Subject: [PATCH] docs: stable-kernel-rules: mention Rust soundness issues

Back in 2023 I asked the stable kernel team whether we could consider
Rust soundness issues for backporting, since we wanted to be able to
protect (as much as possible) downstream users of stable kernels.

After the Rust experiment ended, I documented it in the "Submit checklist
addendum" in our "Subsystem Profile document" [1] (i.e. `P:` entry in
`MAINTAINERS`):

    #### Soundness issues and backporting

    In general, fixes for Rust soundness issues should be marked for
    backport, unless there is a reason not to (such as situations where
    the backport may require a lot of effort but the risk of users
    hitting UB is low).

    For context, while the stable kernel rules mention "theoretical
    issues" should not be backported (which one could argue Rust soundness
    issues are if no existing users hit UB), we discussed the topic of
    Rust soundness issues with the stable team and decided that we would
    do our best to backport them.

    The goal is to help to prevent actual issues for downstream users,
    distributions and vendors that patch the kernel further or even
    add completely new code on top, since those modifications could
    hit UB. In other words, the idea is to maintain the "extra layer"
    of protection in stable kernels too, as much as reasonably possible.

Thus make it clearer by briefly mentioning it as well in the stable
kernel rules.
