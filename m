A bug fixed in one place often exists elsewhere, in copied code, sibling
drivers, or other users of the same interface, and reviewers routinely
ask whether that was checked. Add a read-only procedure that states the
defect as a rule, searches for it through shared interfaces, copied
code, the introducing series, Coccinelle patterns and earlier fixes,
and verifies each candidate before reporting it.

Keep the skill entry point and procedure together under
agents/skills/find-siblings/. Connect it to the coding-assistant guidance
so that the bug-fix procedure looks for the same bug elsewhere after a
fix is verified. The sites found are reported, not fixed; each needs its
own fix, Fixes tag and stable decision.

+
+Finding other instances of a fixed bug
+======================================
+
+A bug fixed in one place often exists elsewhere: in code copied from the same
+origin, in sibling drivers built from a common template, in other users of the
+same interface, or wherever the same mistaken assumption was made. Reviewers
+routinely ask whether other places have the same problem. This procedure
+searches for such sites and verifies each candidate.
+
+The procedure uses read-only inspection. It does not authorize changing files
+in the repository, applying patches, checking out revisions, fetching history,
+or creating or amending commits. Temporary search inputs, such as semantic
+patches, belong outside the repository.
+
+Characterize the defect
+-----------------------
+
+Record the fix and its base revision. For a commit, its parent is the base. For
+uncommitted changes, record the base commit and inspect ``git diff --cached``
+and ``git diff`` separately. If the bug's introducing commit is known, for
+example from agents/skills/find-fixes/guide.rst, record it too.
+
+State the defect as a rule that does not depend on local names: the object or
+resource involved, the operation, the condition that must hold, and what goes
+wrong when it does not. For example, "memory from kvmalloc() is released with
+kfree()", or "a field written under a lock is read before taking that lock and
+used after it". Separate what the fix needs from what it changes
+incidentally, such as variable names, error codes, or surrounding cleanups.
+
+Identify anchors to search for: the functions, macros, structure fields,
+callbacks, and locks involved, and distinctive lines of the code before the
+fix.
+
+Search for candidates
+---------------------
+
+Use several strategies, since each finds a different kind of sibling. Search
+the base revision rather than the working tree, so that the fix being
+prepared does not hide or duplicate results. Start with the same file, driver,
+and subsystem, and widen to the whole tree when an anchor is a common
+interface. Record each search and its scope; the completeness of the result
+depends on them.
+
+* **Same interface.** Find the other callers of a misused function, the other
+  users of the same field or lock, and the other implementations of the same
+  callback::
+
+      git grep -n -w 'function_name' "$base"
+      git grep -n -E '\.callback_name\s*=' "$base"
+
+* **Copied code.** Search for distinctive lines of the code before the fix,
+  and trace where that code came from and where else it was copied::
+
+      git grep -n -F 'distinctive line' "$base"
+      git log --oneline -S 'distinctive line' "$base" -- "$dir"
+
+  A history search without a path walks the entire history and is slow;
+  limit it to the relevant directories. Drivers that were derived from the
+  affected one often say so in their commit messages.
+
+* **Same origin.** If the introducing commit is known, inspect its whole diff
+  and the other patches of its series. A mistake made once is often made in
+  each place the series touched.
+
+* **Structural patterns.** When the defect is a code shape, such as a missing
+  put when leaving a loop or a mismatched allocation and release, write a
+  Coccinelle semantic patch outside the repository and run it with
+  ``make coccicheck``, which supplies the kernel's include paths::
+
+      make coccicheck COCCI=/path/outside/repo/pattern.cocci MODE=context \
+          M=drivers/foo
+
+  See Documentation/dev-tools/coccinelle.rst for the language and the
+  existing semantic patches under ``scripts/coccinelle/``. A semantic patch
+  can miss sites without reporting an error:
+
+  - Check that it reports the known site. Coccinelle reads the working tree,
+    where the fix may already be applied, so run ``spatch --sp-file`` on the
+    file as it was before the fix, extracted outside the repository with
+    ``git show "$base:$path"``.
+  - Header files are only searched with ``SPFLAGS=--include-headers``.
+  - Functions that Coccinelle cannot parse are skipped. Check the searched
+    files with ``spatch --parse-c`` and search any functions it reports as
+    bad by other means.
+
+  If Coccinelle is not available, use regular expressions and report that
+  limitation.
+
+* **Earlier fixes.** Earlier commits fixing the same defect elsewhere show the
+  variants the pattern takes, and may be part of an incomplete sweep::
+
+      git log --oneline -G 'pattern' "$base" -- "$dir"
+
+Validate each candidate
+-----------------------
+
+A textual match is a lead, not a bug. For each candidate, read the complete
+function at the base revision, along with its callers and the relevant
+locking, allocation, and lifetime rules. Establish that the same failure can
+occur there: the triggering condition must be reachable, and nothing else may
+prevent the failure, such as a caller that already holds the lock, an
+allocation that cannot come from vmalloc, a check elsewhere, or a different
+object lifetime. Do not confirm a candidate by analogy alone.
+
+Check whether the candidate is already fixed at the base, or by the change
+being prepared. If other trees, such as linux-next, are available locally,
+check whether a fix is already pending there. Note code that cannot run, such
+as code without callers or code that depends on ``CONFIG_BROKEN``.
+
+Classify each candidate as one of:
+
+* **Confirmed:** the same defect, with an explanation of how it fails there.
+* **Safe:** the same pattern without the defect, with the reason.
+* **Undetermined:** with the information that is missing.
+
+Return the result
+-----------------
+
+Return the search result to the caller. Fixing the sites found, or adding them
+to the fix being prepared, is outside this procedure.
+
+Provide:
+
+* The defect rule searched for, and the base revision.
+* The searches performed and their scope, including any semantic patch used,
+  and their limits, such as unavailable tools or directories not searched.
+* For each confirmed site, its location at the base revision, how the failure
+  occurs there, and its maintainers from ``scripts/get_maintainer.pl -f``.
+* The safe and undetermined candidates, with their reasons.
+
+Each confirmed site is a separate bug. It needs its own fix, and its own Fixes
+tag and stable decision, as described in agents/skills/find-fixes/guide.rst
+and agents/skills/stable-tag/guide.rst. Sites in different drivers or
+subsystems usually get separate patches, possibly in one series.
