Has there been any discussion regarding *how* to do so ? Jon mentioned
that in many cases the failure to disclose is simply due to ignorance.
That could be addressed by more advertising (not entirely sure where
though, documentation isn't always read), or restructuring of
coding-assistants.rst (as far as I understand, the file is supposed to
be consumed by agents, so it should be reasonable to expect the LLM
output to contain a tag).

There are also cases where submitters refuse to comply with the rules
(as in [1] apparently). For those cases, a clear message that
maintainers will be fully supported by the community when they push back
could help.
