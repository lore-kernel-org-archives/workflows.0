I know Kees and Jonathan and others asked for exactly this.  But one
downside to this is it makes just paging through fs/open.c a lot more
painful.  Maybe it's worth it.  Maybe "noone will ever do that again" bc
that's why we have ai and tools.  But a) that's how I've historically
done a lot of code research, b) IMO something like a manpages section 2
under Documentation/ would be a great place for this, and c) we can also
use tools to always sync these, or even show/edit in a single view when
you want  ('kdocedit fs/open.c').
