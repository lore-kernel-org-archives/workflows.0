It=E2=80=99s opt-in on per-subsystem basis, as well as all other email-relat=
ed features.
I do rely on corresponding maintainers to decide if they want it or not.
Even in the case which you was so unhappy about, I asked Guenter prior=20
to enabling it for hwmon.

If you=E2=80=99re saying that it should not send any non-personal emails in g=
eneral, I disagree here,
but happy to have a discussion, assuming it=E2=80=99s polite and constructiv=
e.

The reason why I disagree is simple: there are maintainers/subsystems who li=
ke Sashiko=E2=80=99s reviews=20
and  before introducing the email interface they had to manually send links t=
o Sashiko=E2=80=99s reviews
as replies to proposed patches. I=E2=80=99ve been explicitly asked to add an=
 ability to send out
emails with reviews.

Thanks
