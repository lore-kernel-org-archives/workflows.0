Do you really want to be this specific?

Take this fix for example that I mentioned the other day:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-wireless/patch/20260531145435.70=
1703-1-runyu.xiao@seu.edu.cn/

It doesn't formally fall under that definition, but I think it should,
it's a silly thing to send to stable etc.

This isn't even a USB device where you could reasonably argue that
someone might plug in a random one and it could be programmed to look
like the device in question and misbehave. Sure, you can build PCIe
hardware too that can do that, technically, and there's technically
external PCIe via Thunderbolt, but it's still far harder to actually do
anything with.

> + - bug was discovered by a static analysis / AI tool;

I'm not (yet?) convinced that this bullet point is right.

It risks getting into an argument about how much the LLM did to discover
it, or if the actual discovery was a manual process after the LLM
pointed out issues, or whatever ...

Maybe more importantly, why should that even change the result?

It's true that today the reason to start spelling this out more clearly
is AI related, but that's really because of (a) the scale, and (b) many
of the people running the LLMs not being aware of (and frankly often not
really caring about) the community norms. I'm not convinced that the
"silliness" of a change should be measured by how it originated.

> + - bug was triggered/observed only with kernel changes or fault injectio=
n.

Given this fourth bullet point, we'd still accept fixes for such driver
problems that people actually run into, while excluding "theoretical"
things that are discovered by "reading the code".
