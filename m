I don't think we want to automate rejection of patches that provide no
base information, and certainly not as a first step. The goal as I see
it is to encourage people to provide the information. It's a process
that will take time.

It doesn't have to require manual work every time you send paches.
format.useAutoBase in conjunction with specifying upstreams of branches
helps.

That's not my claim.
