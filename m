You can run the tool locally, with whatever model you want, if you want
to.

But for now, let's just take the free credits that Google is willing to
throw at this thing and let it give us reviews IF the maintainer of the
subsystem feels it is something they want to do.  No one is forcing
maintainers to do this.

The netdev, bpf, and drm developers have been doing much the same for a
while now, with who-knows-what model behind the thing.  The model
doesn't matter, we aren't advertising for them, we just want the results
that they can provide us.
