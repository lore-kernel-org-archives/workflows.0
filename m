Hi Nicolai,

maybe I am missing something but [2] isn't from sashiko.dev but from 
netdev AI CI instead. See: 
https://netdev-ai.bots.linux.dev/ai-review.html?id=0b114a22-9aab-4265-8bfc-ea1b5bca5514

The documentation mentioned for running the AI locally is correctly 
related to netdev AI bot.

I think it would be useful to document that AI reviews are happening but 
mixing AI bots might confuse people.

I wonder what would be the consequences for this. If less experienced 
submitters are expected to address issues pointed out by AI bots they 
might work on something that isn't valid. AFAIU, the AI output is only 
forwarded to the submitter after a maintainer reviewed it and believes 
it makes sense.

Thanks,
Fernando.
