I consistently see new contributors getting involved in the kernel who
are not using LLM tooling. This is still very much a thing, and I would
advise against missing the forest for the trees because the new
contributors with LLM tooling are so much louder then the ones without
because only one of those two groups can send patch bombs at a moment's
notice that require going through in order to know whether or not to
ignore it.

This is an open source project, submitting work - even for people using
LLMs - should be one of the ways that people can get involved. It has
far less barriers to attending a conference in person, and not all
contributors can or want to be at an in-person event just to contribute
to a project.

Also - I've been a kernel maintainer and I've never been at LPC. I know
plenty of people who have never been to LPC, it is more then just
financial constraints. If an LPC is so truly representative of
maintainers at large here, then why are there maintainers responding
here with objections? What challenge would there be to actually opening
this discussion up to all of the other maintainers who were not there?

It is, though. I want people who actually took the time to learn how to
contribute to a codebase I maintain to actually have some kind of
priority over new contributors using LLMs, because we still attract new
contributors and talent who don't want anything to do with LLMs.
Projects like Asahi I've pretty much only started getting involved in
because of their no LLM policy.

Have you considered that maybe this is a self-fulfilling prophecy that
is partly the result of a lack of maintainers and the difficulty
imposed on new contributors getting involved because of policies like
"just ignore work and don't respond if it looks like slop"? The person
who could contribute and decides it's not welcoming, or there's not
much chance of their work getting reviewed, etc. is not typically the
person that says so on a mailing list, or as I've started seeing - just
simply doesn't want to look at the project because they are not
enthusiastic about working with LLMs in their spare time or ever. More
likely, they just leave and don't contribute.

Has the rest of the kernel really gotten so bad at attracting new
contributors outside of LLM spheres you just, don't get these people
anymore?
