docs: netdev: additional info requirements for bug fixes

This commit adds a "Bug fixes" section to maintainer-netdev.rst. The
section requires fixes to state how the bug was discovered and validated,
and how the fix was tested. It also asks for short reproducers to go in the
commit message, with longer ones linked online.

[Severity: Medium]
Could this conflict with Documentation/process/security-bugs.rst for fixes
to bugs that were found with AI tools?

The new section covers all bug fixes. It asks for short reproducers in the
commit message and a public link for longer ones.

security-bugs.rst says bugs found with AI assistance must be treated as
public, and then says:

  case, do not publicly share a reproducer, as this could cause unintended harm;
  just mention that one is available and maintainers might ask for it privately
  if they need it.

It says the same thing again in the AI tools section:

  Note that since the
  report will be posted to a public list, the reproducer should only be
  shared upon maintainers' request.

The Security fixes section later in maintainer-netdev.rst tells people to
use the mailing lists and not contact the netdev maintainers directly. A fix
for an AI-found security bug in networking code would therefore be posted
publicly, and the reproducer would stay in git history.

For that case, the new text says to publish the reproducer and
security-bugs.rst says not to. The commit message says AI-generated patches
are the main target, and security-bugs.rst is written for the same group.

Would it help to add an exception for security-relevant fixes here, or a
pointer to security-bugs.rst, so the two documents agree?
