I agree that it would be good to have a record of the actual test results
uploaded somewhere. For the start, I think it's fine to just have them
uploaded to places like Dropbox or Google Drive, or whatever can be accessed
with an unauthenticated URL.

Otherwise I'm seriously considering opening up submissions to KCIDB for the
general (authenticated) public (with pre-moderation and whitelisting). That
would require a bunch of work, though. We already have basic artifact
mirroring system, but it relies on the submitter hosting the files somewhere
in the first place. So we'd have to add some file upload service to that. And
then we'd have to think really hard on how to keep the access public, and at
the same time not to go bankrupt from somebody scraping our archive in S3
storage. Any help would be super-welcome!

I think we can make space for the results URL after the test name in the
Tested-with: tag. We can probably make up some syntax for the V: field that
would say if the URL is required or not, but it could just be always accepted.
It will be the maintainer's call to require it or not.

I think it should be up to the test to define what their output should be, and
it would be very hard (and not that useful) to unify them in a single output
format (speaking from Red Hat's CKI experience executing many different suites
for the kernel). The test name in the Tested-with: tag would help identify the
format, if necessary.
