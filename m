I hear your pain, and I'm sure it's more painful than what I experience
in my corner of the kernel. I know how the sense of duty feels as a
maintainer. It may not make a big difference, but I want to say you have
no duty to burn out. If you decided to slow down merging patches in MM
to get more sleep until we find a better solution to cope with the
unsustainable work load, I would support that.

It increasingly feel we need to also look at long term solutions.
There's a sort of knee-jerk short term reaction that I can understand.
On the longer term, I agree with Lyude that any solution will involve
increasing the number of reviewers and maintainers.

I fully understand that many maintainers currently feel they're too
pressured to invest time in the next generation. We need to find
solutions to make that possible.

If we stop investing in the next generation, the project will die too,
in a worse way in my opinion.

Thank you for taking the time to clarify this. I'm happy to read I
misunderstand you. E-mail communication is horrible to discuss these
topics, especially in public.

This is something we really need to improve quickly. Over the past week
multiple active kernel developers asked me if I thought they needed to
find a job elsewhere, thinking maintainers will now ignore anything but
perfect patches and dismiss contributions from developers who don't use
LLMs. That's a wrong impression (at least I very much hope so, and you
clarified that you're not advocating for that), but it's a disastrous
impression that many people got from the maintainers summit and the
following mailing lists discussions.

I'd like to see more maintainers clarifying this publicly, like you have
done.
