Yes, I explicitly said this in response to somebody for whom there was
overwhelming evidence they were submitting AI slop, and that they'd need to
build it back up again.

It's precisely the issue as I see it.

But others within the community disagreed with me, so it turned into a very
long and draining discussion that I don't particularly wish to repeat.

So we really need clarity on it being OK to do this (I remember saying this
last year when I made an ultimately unsuccessful submission to the
maintainer's summit about all this :)

What matters overall is being able to _quickly_ dismiss AI slop so that
asymmetry between LLM generation + maintainer time isn't exploited.

And ultimately I think the trust model will end up being 'newcomes have 0,
now build it up'.

Which sucks but this issue is simply existential for open source.
