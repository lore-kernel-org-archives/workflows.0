Submitting bug reports to LLMs is something we can and should aspire to
do, and maybe one of these LLMs will have sufficient context window and
processing power to take all of what we've written here as a prompt to 
build and demonstrate a deterministic code generation tool where the
code produced by the tool and the entire process that produced it back 
to the underlying training data can be fully disclosed and discussed.

I'd challenge anyone that believes that "LLMs don't work like that" to 
try running code generation with temperature=0, and let us know, what
happens?

Just because pretty much any commercial machine that uses IEEE derived
floating point and parallel execution can't practically produce the same
answer from the same inputs does not mean it's not possible. It just 
means no one has yet put in the engineering effort.

Good engineering with monte-carlo models or other tools that depend on
a random number "seed" seems to involve multiple runs, with different 
seeds, and when you are working on a something involving human life
safety or otherwise have to satisfy some regulator or reviewer that the
simulation work you did is repeatable, is specify something about how
many runs you did, with what codebases, and how much divergence did you
get from different runs and different seeds.

You see this with weather models, where an ensemble of models is used to
map and quantify the uncertainty in the projected path of a hurricane.

We can and should apply the same rigor to kernel engineering, and keep
an awareness of what models produce what kind of code, if for no other
reason than to provide some additional forensic data if or when we
discover the first evidence of an intentional LLM generated zero-day
that slipped by human review.
