I personally think 1-2 are the only relevant cases.

Yup, and we don't need complicated rules for that just 'document what you used
it for and give a sense of how much'.

It's fuzzy but useful.

Not to go over it all again but I disagree, even as it stands, it allows us to
engage in conversation about the LLM usage if admitted, and to point those who
are misbehaving at the rules if not.

And it is a clear way to get the boolean 'is this person saying they used an
LLM'.

But I agree with you it'd be MUCH more useful if we did the above.

I wonder if we could get consensus on adding a section to the doc saying that
it'd be _useful_ to add a comment explaining _what_ you did, and explaining the
concept with some examples?

I can't imagine anybody would disagree with that, and that would get us positive
forward progress.

Then later we could debate the details further?
