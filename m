It should also be noted that Intel's zero-day bot was (a) closed
source, and (b) was sending its test regression reports with the
linux-kernel mailing list cc'ed, and no one really complained because
it was so useful, and if Intel was willing to use very expensive
hardware in their data center to contribute reports, so long as the
reports were useful and the false-positive noise was low enough, we
decided to be grateful and not worry (too much) about the fact that
Intel's zero-day bot was closed source.  (There was indeed some
grumbling in the bar at Plumbers, of course.  :-)

In my opinion, we should be doing the same for Sashiko, and that's the
decision which the ext4 developers have made --- at least for ext4
patches, after an experiment where we only sent reviews to the patch
authors and the maintainer, people were satisifed that false positive
rate was low enough (with the caveats that I had previously mentioned,
but we were willing to live with them because at least for us, it was
useful enough), that we will be requesting that Sashiko reviews be
cc'ed to the ext4 mailing list.

I realize that there are some extra sensitivities around AI / LLM's,
but from the perspective of reviewing patches, I don't see any
difference between this and other closed source tools that we've used,
such as Coverity and the Zero-day bot.  Not everyone will agree, of
course, but at the moment, this is a decision that we are making on a
subsystem by subsystem basis, which again, has strong historical
precedence.

Cheers,
