It's total insanity to expect from maintainers to deal with huge, deep, changes
in core subsystems by total unknown people, like you've had to deal with. What is
the chance you happen to refuse a commit by an isolated genius that just happen
to be able to do deep work without any kind of work leading up to that. And even
then, if they are genuinely a genius, it very likely won't smell like AI slop.
