Nobody has stepped up to maintain bugzilla for the past 10 years. Managing
components, products, assignees -- that's not the job of the infrastructure
team. Linux development is so compartmentalized that cross-subsystem tasks
like bug reporting have been thoroughly neglected.

However, I would argue that bugzilla needs fewer components, not more of them.
Otherwise people get confused and file bugs against "kernel.org" or whatever
happens to be the first entry in the list. For bugzilla to be useful, it needs
to have a bugmaster -- and nobody has volunteered thus far. It's not something
that members of the LF IT team can do, since none of us are kernel developers.

If someone steps up, I'll be happy to grant them admin rights to manage all
the components, etc.

Email is a poor choice when someone needs to share large files (usually,
dumps). Besides, I really don't want stuff like that in public-inbox archives,
either.

This is one major upside of bugzilla -- it can still be largely email-based,
but it also provides a way to share large files without the need to ship them
around as attachments or use some other 3rd-party file sharing services.

All that really needs to happen to improve the situation:

1. have an actual kernel developer be responsible for managing bugzilla; this
   person would manage components and keep an eye on new bugs to make sure
   they get to proper subsystem owners

That's it, there are no other entries here. Bugzilla *can* be a useful tool
and works reasonably well with email back-and-forth, but nobody wants to do
this work -- so everyone ends up blaming the tool.
