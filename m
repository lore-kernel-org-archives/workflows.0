I actually wrote:

    Many patches still don't include base tree information and can't be
    applied.  Such patches can't be properly reviewed or tested, nor can
    they be accepted. 

So it's about patches that can't be applied due to lack of base tree
information (due to the obvious guess not working).  Not merely the lack
of such information by itself.
