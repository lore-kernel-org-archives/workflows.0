How do you need an LLM to assist you with making a symlink?

Okay, all the other conversation aside. When I see an AGENT.md file in
a code repository, I see:

- This project likely accepts LLM code (which is true for Linux)
- There is a file that provides a cute little "all you need to know
about this" file for our matrix multiplication machines
- There could be parts of code that are entirely LLM-written. (may or
may not be true here?)

I think the existence of said file can also imply to someone who is
meat proxying "here's your AGENTS file, go wild!".

I don't see how the addition of this file is worth it, aside from
helping LLMs, in which the users of the LLM should be directing the
agent to the proper documentation anyway. That ensures that you have
a human directing the agent.

Honestly this looks a lot like, "we have our altar to our LLM
overlords". The kernel existed without LLMs for years. We don't need
a file to make LLMs happy and then have LLM companies say "we are so
important we made a major project that runs most of the world's tech
infrastructure have to provide us guidelines!" - which I guess we
already have.

Anyway.

Don't we want humans to read the documentation before contributing?

I feel like this will just lead to more people going "Agent. Read
AGENT.md. Find bug. Hiyah!" and then meat proxying patches without
generally learning or being helpful.

This is an opportunity of a sanity test for humans to know what they
are doing before just throwing stuff at the LLM. Why are we throwing
that out?

And if the argument is "but tokens!", then won't it also take some
tokens for the agent to process "oh this file is a symlink"?

I find it hard to take this suggestion seriously.
