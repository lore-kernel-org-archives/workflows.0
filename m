Yeah, for me moving ath11k bugs away from Drivers/network-wireless
component is not really helpful. And for ath11k I try to look at all
reported bugs in bugzilla anyway, though just slowly.

While at it, I have some things on my wishlist to make my use of
bugzilla.kernel.org easier:

* A new state named UNCONFIRMED and have it as the default state for
  reported bugs. This would help triaging bugs as some of the reports
  are not valid. In other words only valid bugs would have NEW state.
  IIRC the Mozilla project did this back in the day.

* Use P3 as the default priority for the new bugs. I try to keep ath11k
  bugs in priority order but new reported bugs having P1 always messes
  up the list always.
