Thanks, that is a good distinction. I think my wording here was misleading.

By “PoC”, I do not mean an exploit demonstrating security impact or
privilege escalation. The PoC generated at this stage is only intended
to reproduce the reported bug. For example, by triggering a KASAN
report, a kernel crash, or another observable runtime failure.

So the purpose of this step is primarily to validate reachability:
whether there exists a concrete execution path that causes the reported
bug to manifest at runtime.

This is substantially easier than exploit generation, especially with
sanitizer feedback available. More importantly, if the LLM has explored
all reachable paths relevant to the reported bug and none of them can
trigger the reported behavior, then we consider the report very likely
to be a false positive. 

In practice, of course, failure to generate a PoC is not formal proof
that the bug does not exist, but failing to find a triggering path after
exploring the relevant reachable paths still provides useful evidence
that the report may be a false positive.

I should change the text to distinguish a reproduction PoC from an
exploit PoC and avoid equating “not exploitable” with “false positive.”

Separately, we have also built a system for analyzing exploitability,
primarily whether a bug can be turned into a local privilege escalation.
This is a different stage from the reproduction PoC described above. We
can integrate that analysis into the platform as well, although it will
take some additional time to do so. In the meantime, we should be able
to import some of the existing analysis results first.
