That's most kind Greg, thank you, have missed all you cool kids too :)

More seriously though - I'd be up for doing it, but I think there may be 
others better placed than I who haven't yet realised we have this 
conundrum. I'm nudging a few folks offline on this front.

I've also kicked off a thread in linux-hams to discuss some of the 
broader questions raised about staying in tree, going to out of tree or 
looking at userspace solutions instead.

We'll try get a cohesive picture back over next few days.

Cheers,
Hugh
