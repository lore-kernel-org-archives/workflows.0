The absence of the tag on a suspicious series offered a low-effort way
for maintainers to push back. What's the proposed low-effort replacement
?

Listing the prompts seems fairly useless to me. Not only do prompts
capture only a small submit of the information you would want (many
people use custom agent files with lots of rules that supplement the
prompts), they don't show that the submitter understands what they're
doing.

Mesa has a policy that LLM-generated code *must* have a human-written
commit message. They go one step further by requiring all comments in
the code to also be human-written. That seems a better (but possibly not
good enough) way to try and gauge the level of understand from the
submitter.
