Subject: [PATCH v3 7/7] agents: add a skill to write commit messages

Assistants are asked to commit a fix with a detailed message, and the
find-fixes and stable-tag skills leave their tags for that message, but
nothing says how to write it. Messages written by assistants tend to be
long, and Linus recently asked that pull request text written with an
LLM be less verbose and prefer the imperative voice.

Add a skill that sends the agent to the parts of submitting-patches.rst,
5.Posting.rst and the maintainer documentation that cover commit
messages, cover letters and pull requests, and to the P: profiles of the
changed files. It adds what agents get wrong: stating only what the
change and the supplied sources support, keeping the text short and in
the imperative mood, and adding no tags that were not supplied.

Point the bug-fix procedure in coding-assistants.rst at the skill.

+# Write a commit message
+
+Read "Describe your changes", the sections on tags, "The canonical patch
+format" and "Commentary" in Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst, and
+Documentation/process/5.Posting.rst for cover letters. Follow the maintainer
+profiles, the `P:` entries in MAINTAINERS, for the changed files; they take
+precedence. Follow the rules for skills and for attribution in
+Documentation/process/coding-assistants.rst, and
+Documentation/process/generated-content.rst when a tool found the problem.
+When editing someone else's message, also follow
+Documentation/maintainer/modifying-patches.rst.
+
+- State only what the diff and the sources you were given support, such as a
+  bug report, a crash log, test results, or the list discussion found with
+  `lei q` on lore.kernel.org. If the reason for the change is not known,
+  return no message and say what is missing.
+- Take the Fixes and stable tags from the find-fixes and stable-tag skills.
+  Add other tags only when they were supplied or given on the list. Never add
+  a Signed-off-by.
+- Use the imperative mood and keep the message as short as its content
+  allows. Leave out markdown, labels such as "Root cause:", intensifiers, a
+  restatement of the subject, and the story of the investigation.
+- Check the result with `scripts/checkpatch.pl --no-signoff`.
+
+For the signed tag and email of a pull request, follow
+Documentation/maintainer/pull-requests.rst,
+Documentation/maintainer/rebasing-and-merging.rst and
+Documentation/maintainer/messy-diffstat.rst. Summarize what the pull contains
+and why from the commit messages in the range, in the same voice, without
+repeating the shortlog. Ask the caller for conflict resolutions and testing
+that the history does not show.
