I understand the concern is having the information in the git log.  I agree in
a level.  I wish cloning linux takes not too long time and huge traffic.  I
wish each commit message be lengthy only as much as needed.

I also agree having a formal tag can be convenient.  LWN's Assisted-by: tag
statistic was interesting enough to make me supporting this idea.

What about keep requesting this formal signature to the submitters, but also
formally allow (or, encourage) subsystem maintainers to remove the tags when
pull-request?  That's already allowed, to my understanding and some maintainers
are doing [1] today.   That can help preventing the git history of a subsystem
bloating or advertising priorietary companies, as much as the maintainer care.
Meanwhile, we can still get the information at review time, and also after
review from the mail archives.  It will still be handy as long as we use tools
like 'lei'.  As some maintainers are already removing the tags from the git
log, this may be anyway a better way.  Someone may interested in only their
subsystem history, but I find LLM users tend to contribute to multiple
subsystems, so this might actually matters.

It might be too clear to formally document this, though.
