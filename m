Some bugs are outside the threat model because their exploitation
requires very specific conditions (dedicated network link, crafted
device, crafted file system image only root may mount), but they may
still have a security impact for a few users, and a CVE may be assigned
later. These are handled publicly as regular bugs, but their reproducers
and exploits must never be shared on public lists since that could put
the few exposed users at risk.

The documentation was never very clear about this and a few reporters
were put in embarrassing situations while trying to follow the process,
because threat-model says to check reporting-issues which asks for public
repros. There shouldn't be any ambiguity because reporters reading these
files already come with the idea of reporting a security issue.

Let's clarify this point in threat-model.rst and point to this from
security-bugs.rst.
