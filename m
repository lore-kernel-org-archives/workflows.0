A couple of updates since my last email:

Previously, the bug list was not automatically filtered based on the
maintainer’s subsystems in the MAINTAINERS file after login. This has
now been fixed.

Also, a quick update for netdev:

We recently ran exploitability analysis on several hundred bugs and
imported the results into the tracker, so you can now directly see which
bugs appear to have higher security impact.

We identified 55 bugs that can be used for local privilege escalation.
The good news is that 46 of them have already been fixed, while 9 are
still unfixed. Fortunately, 8 of those 9 require |CONFIG_USER_NS=y| to
be exploitable.

I’m especially proud that students on my team contributed 34 of the
patches for those fixes, and I’m very grateful to the maintainers for
all the reviews and guidance. Once we finish the patches we’re currently
looking at, we’ll start working on these newly identified
privilege-escalation bugs.

The exploitability analysis still has to be run manually and is not yet
integrated into the system. Once the full pipeline is integrated, it
should make it much easier to see which bugs pose a greater security risk.

So although the LLM has found a large number of bugs, only a very small
fraction of them appear to be usable for local privilege escalation.

If any maintainers outside netdev are interested in using the tracker,
just let me know. I can prioritize importing the fixed bugs and Sashiko
findings for those subsystems first. Cleaning and importing the data
takes some time.
