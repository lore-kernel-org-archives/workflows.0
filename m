I'd suggest the original commit that introduced the issue, or if you really
want to - add two Fixes: tags.

My reasoning is that if there were holes around the reachability of the issue
in the past, we want to land the fix on all relevant trees, rather than just
the ones affected by the most recent case that enabled it to happen.

For example, let's say an issue was introduced in v6.5 and was reachable by one
codepath. Later, in v6.7, we refactored some code and made is issue benign by
removing the only codepath that could reach it. Even later, a new commit in
v7.0 made the issue reachable again.

If our Fixes: tag points to the v7.0 re-introduction, then we will miss the
backport to the v6.6 tree.
