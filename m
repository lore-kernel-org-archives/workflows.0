Current documentation states:

	A Fixes: tag indicates that the patch fixes a bug in a previous commit. It
	is used to make it easy to determine where an issue originated, which can help
	review a bug fix. This tag also assists the stable kernel team in determining
	which stable kernel versions should receive your fix. This is the preferred
	method for indicating a bug fixed by the patch. See :ref:`describe_changes` 
	for more details.


the second part is easy to miss, so "what about an old bug in commit A
commit B exposes" and "what if the bug both in commit A and commit B"
are pretty common questions.




Worth answering, maybe, and maybe here: the implication of the "stable
kernel team" rule is that the meaning of the tag is actually: "if you
have commit A then you need this commit".
