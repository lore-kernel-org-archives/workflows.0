You missed that Konstantin (now CCed) is just a bit careful for the
bugbot bring up and therefore for now only allows bugbot to be enabled
for BZ entries that are filed against the product/component combination
Linux/Kernel. I could reassigning bugs there, but that would break the
workflow for maintainers like Kalle, which look at all bugs assigned to
their product/component combo (Drivers/network-wireless in Kalle's case).

Ciao, Thorsten
