Has anybody tried throwing any of the obvious LLM slop submissions we
have seen into one of these LLM detector things? To be clear, I've never
tried those so I'm certainly no authority on if they even work reliably,
but if so I wonder if something like that is a potential solution for
elminating the worst cases..

I.e., suppose we had some Sashiko type LLM/bot whose job was mainly to
detect purely LLM generated content based on some minimum level of
confidence and reply with a loud and clear message to the thread. Maybe
that would be a clear enough signal to maintainers and reviewers that
something is not worth prioritizing for review.. Maybe also some "slop
detected" feedback would help disincentivize flinging slop onto the
lists. At the very least that could be something that is more easily
configured/enabled per-subsystem without having to use per-subsystem
commit tags.
