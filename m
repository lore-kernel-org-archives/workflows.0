Agreed, and the rules in coding-assistants.rst are the part that should
always apply.

Your issue is with coding-assistants.rst, which says agents must not add
Signed-off-by. AGENTS.md only makes agents see it.

Codex reads AGENTS.override.md in place of AGENTS.md. Claude Code doesn't load
AGENTS.md at all when a CLAUDE.md exists, and Gemini reads GEMINI.md unless
configured otherwise.

The agents are designed exactly for this model: the upstream project has it's
own AGENT.md which is relevant for the upstream side of things. Downstream is
able to modify it as needed, either by carrying an out of tree patch, an
override file, or whatever else works for downstream.

Changes to coding-assistants.rst itself are fair game as separate patches. This
one only gets agents to load what we already ask them to follow. There's no
substance here - we're just making dumb machines behave better.

I get that you have concerns with those docs, so feel free to propose patches
for these.

I do not thing we need a seperate machine-only readable set of docs. If these
"agents" can't do better parsing those docs, then we shouldn't bend over and
write them their own versions. I'm okay with doing better at pointing to those
docs ("RTFM!"), but I don't think that a fork of the docs is sensible.

If you disagree, feel free to propose changes to coding-assistants.rst, as this
is really a doc that gets read mostly by machines.
