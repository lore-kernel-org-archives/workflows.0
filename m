What sucks here is that these prompts aren't very human readable. They are
overly verbose, they assume being able to remember a whole bunch of small
instructions, and target specific issues that we're observing with these
agents.

I get why Documentation/ makes sense (it's not code per-se), but I could also
argue similarily for tools/ :)

Either way, I don't really think it matters to me, and will happily move it to
Documentation/agents/ unless someone else chimes in with a reason NOT to...
