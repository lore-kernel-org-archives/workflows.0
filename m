I'm not even sure the prejudice is unnecessary, given how studies point
to the cognitive decline impact of generative AI usage.

I have previously heard long-term, experienced developers saying they
handle review feedback by "doing whatever the reviewer asks" without
"really trying to understand" in order to get their code merged. That
doesn't lead to very good long term results. When such developers turn
to LLMs to write code, I'm pretty sure the prejudice is warranted.
