But you were there at LPC! Sorry, was planning to go to your talk, but
couldn't :( . Would have loved to chat with you.

I doubt how many people are like this. You have to contribute A LOT of
time to get to a meaningful level of understanding of even just one
subsystem, even with LLM support. I know some people don't travel, but
I didn't suggest that conference attendance should be the only avenue
to participate.
