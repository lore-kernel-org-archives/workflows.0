great, thx!

Nearly, as mentioned above: it should be everybody in the signed-off-by
chain (as explained in reporting-issues.rst), as that will catch
co-developers and the people that handled the change on the way.

The normal magic you described that bugbot applies to match reports to
subsystems is also needed, as otherwise lists and co-maintainer would
not be in the loop.

That's good to know and likely will be handy sometimes, but well, for
regular use of the bugzilla->mailing list use-case it would be slightly
annoying if you'd first have to tell bugzilla to create a ml thread,
which you then need to find to write a reply to add people to the CC.

Ciao, Thorsten
