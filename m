My argument to keep "assisted-by:" as optional but highly desired commit
metadata is based on understanding. If you have a culture of being able
to explain things to humans, then make it easy for both humans and their
assistive techonology to know exactly *what* technology is being used, 
and where to get it.

Hell, I would expect the proprietary LLM vendors would have a strong
incentive to keep the free advertising. I personally haven't yet asked
an LLM yet to write a thesis on the subject, but you can probably place a
bet that I'll feed this message into a couple of assistive technologies
and try to make the most compelling argument that any company operating
under US securities rules might want to have their legal department review
the company policy on what to put in the Assisted-by: signoff.

A clear structured header is easy to ignore, and the cost to maintain
is minimal once we have consensus to retain it.
