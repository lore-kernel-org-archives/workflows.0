This appears to me as similar to the words we decided to ban in commit
a5f526ecb075 ("CodingStyle: Inclusive Terminology"). As far as I'm
aware, there's no tooling to enforce this, we instead rely on reviewers
(and authors in the first place of course) knowing the rules. The
inclusive terminology discussion that occurred back then made the news,
helping us to raise awareness of the rules. For gender-neutral pronouns
we may need to communicate a bit more proactively towards at least
subsystem maintainers.
