I am saying it is up to the maintainer. The word is out and we are allowed to
ignore poor contributions, in particular if they are LLM generated. The whole point
is that in the past poor contributions were still a signal someone was trying and
it might be worthwhile to help them to grow. It is not that signal anymore per se.
We need other avenues to identify talent. The kernel mentorship program is one of
those, as is showing up in person at conferences.

The tag helped some maintainers to push back (like Lorenzo). The tag isn't needed
anymore, because the push back isn't needed. I think that's an improvement, and at
any rate was inevitable.

Best,
Jori.
