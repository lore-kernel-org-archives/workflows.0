I think there's also a penality for those who don't disclose when
they're told they should: it will lower trust. Kernel development is
largely based on a trust model. If a contributor decides to adopt a
deceiptful behaviour, they can expect maintainers to raise the bar for
accepting patches, when not rejecting them outright.

I can't quantifying which of the penalities will be higher, but I hope
(call me naive if you wish) that the vast majority of contributurs who
*know* we require disclosure to abide by that rule, even if it incurs a
penalty. After all, proponents for LLM usage claim such performance
improvements that a small penalty during review can't be that bad, right
? :-)
