There are subsystems which want email reviews to be sent to the subsystem
mailing list. In fact, all currently configured email policies came from mai=
ntainers,
I don=E2=80=99t push anything based on my own preferences.=20

Sashiko can be configured the way you describe it or in any other way, it=E2=
=80=99s up to corresponding=20
maintainers.

I agree, it=E2=80=99s sometimes gets tricky when a patchset is sent to multi=
ple mailing lists,
which policy to apply. I have some improvements in my plans, but it=E2=80=99=
s not always possible
to say how it should be handled. It=E2=80=99s not fundamentally new: landing=
 changes touching=20
multiple subsystems is always harder exactly because maintainers might have d=
ifferent
and sometimes conflicting views.
