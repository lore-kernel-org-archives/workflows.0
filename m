They didn't in my tests. Without AGENTS.md, neither agent opened README before
committing, and one of them added my Signed-off-by. Could you share how you

With the symlink, README's content is loaded directly, so no @ import is
needed, and neither agent went on to read README's other pointers.

It didn't in my tests either. With AGENTS.md pointing at README, one agent read
only coding-assistants.rst, and the other read that plus generated-content.rst,
which coding-assistants.rst references. Neither opened any of README's other
pointers.

Every model call resends the whole context, so that applies to any AGENTS.md,
including a hand-written one. Either way, most of it is served from the prompt
cache.

The rules README points to (DCO, Assisted-by, patch format) are the same for
every model. Personal and model-specific tuning belongs in a personal file.
Your sample shows why the shared part should come from the tree: it asks the
agent to add your Signed-off-by, which coding-assistants.rst says an agent must
never do.

Agents already have personal/override files to handle this.

We also already track .clang-format, .editorconfig and .rustfmt.toml on the
same terms. Ignoring AGENTS.md would leave users who don't write their own with
nothing, and a template has the same problem unless someone actually copies it.
