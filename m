When I review patches, I often need to apply them to a tree, mainly to
see the context, but sometimes also to test them. I have encountered
many cases where the patch wouldn't apply on the current for-next branch
of the relevant subsystem. That's often because the patch had
dependencies. When I'm lucky they are listed manually in the cover
letter with a link to a branch, but that's far from being the common
case. I then have to ask the submitter to provide a branch, or enough
information to recreate a branch. Having base information (base-commit,
prerequisite-patch-id, and possibly base-tree) would save me quite some
time.

I understand your concern about maintainers cherry-picking and sometimes
introducing issues as a result. In that case I also prefer asking the
submitter to rebase, retest, and resubmit. That's not what I want to use
base information for, in my case it helps with the review process.
