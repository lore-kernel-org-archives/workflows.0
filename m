Which improvements do you have in mind?

It can also be relevant in cases where only a single subsystem is touched.

For instance, in the case of Rust, the rust-for-linux list serves two purpo=
ses
-- when it is a Rust subsystem change and when Rust code of any other subsy=
stem
is touched, i.e. the rust-for-linux list has more of a LKML character and a=
lso
receives patches for subsystems whose maintainers may not have opted in to
sashiko email delivery.

That said, I personally don't mind too much, I really like sashiko, which i=

also why I asked for adding the driver-core list. My experience has been th=
at it
does a very decent job in providing feedback for C code; my feeling is that
feedback for Rust code is not quite on par yet, but of course it also highl=
y
depends on the complexity and scope of the corresponding changes.

However, I still have the same concern I raised previously when it comes to
email delivery: I think that when sashiko sends feedback to contributors
(without Cc'ing the mailing list and all other recipients), it should activ=
ely
ask the contributor to raise things on the list with all other recipients,
reviewers and maintainers before acting on them, such that changes subseque=
nt to
the first submission on the list are aligned.

Can this be added please?

Thanks,
Danilo
