Yeah that's fair, but my thinking is the goal would be more to detect
slop content as opposed to just LLM usage. The trend of these
discussions has been that we generally don't care too much about LLM use
in general when it's used properly as a tool, but rather as you stated
earlier we want to be able to quickly dismiss slop to avoid wasting
maintainer and reviewer time.

It seems like we're generally able to sniff out pure LLM generated
content in most cases. That suggests we should be able document some
common patterns that tend to describe slop such that an LLM bot could
detect and flag it. For example, "Slop bot has detected comments have
LLM prose and just repeat what the code does," "Slop bot has detected
unnecessary code volume and duplication," etc. etc.

So the idea with that would be that defeating the slop bot is the point.
Consider it a sort of informal/minimal goal before a submitter is
entitled to human review. But yeah, I guess it's still just a handwavy
theory that you'd be able to reliably disentagle detection of general
LLM code generation from something that more qualifies as LLM slop. Just
thinking out loud.
