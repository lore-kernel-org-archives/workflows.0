I also checked the x86-64 fast-path code generation as suggested. In
paired GCC and Clang comparisons, I found no new calls, stack spills,
stack-frame adjustment, or callee-saved register saves on the disabled
path. The detailed `__tsan_read8` disassembly comparison is in my reply to
patch 1:

Not exactly. This interface is not intended to prove that all accesses
to a variable are race-free. The motivating use case is narrower: after
a reproducer or report points to a suspicious address, make accesses
overlapping that address eligible for watchpoint setup without unrelated
accesses consuming the skip interval.

I agree that function-scoped filtering and stress testing remain useful
for looking for races around code changed in a fix. Targeted mode is
complementary to that workflow when a known low-frequency location is
difficult to reproduce.

In the motivating loadavg run, targeting `calc_load_idx` produced a KCSAN
report involving `calc_global_load()` and `calc_load_nohz_start()`. A separate
upstream run with the default `kcsan.skip_watch=4000` did not report those
locations during its test window. This is evidence for that workload and
window, not proof that the accesses are race-free when no report appears.

Yes, bypassing the normal `kcsan.skip_watch` interval for matching
accesses is the intended tradeoff in this RFC. Nonmatching accesses
neither set up a watchpoint nor consume that interval. `target=off`
restores normal sampling. Targeted mode is intended for focused debugging,
not steady-state use.

The hot-target cost is therefore expected. In the RFC measurements an
enabled nonmatching target was 26.981 ns/access versus 24.549 ns/access
upstream, while a deliberately hot matching target measured 81.1 us/access
because every matching access entered `kcsan_setup_watchpoint()`.

Thanks. I'll keep the debugfs interface as proposed.
