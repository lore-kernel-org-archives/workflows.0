We've dealt with coccinelle-generated code changes for ages without
Assisted-by tags and without any issue. Submitters typically include the
semantic patch in the commit message, or just mentioned coccinelle was
used. I personally feel that the apparent generic scope of the
Assisted-by trailer tag, and the fact that this is documented in a file
named generated-content.rst, is an attempt to pretend generative AI is
"just another tool" comparable to coccinelle or checkpatch.
