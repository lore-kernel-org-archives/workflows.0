To ignore it, really. Even less effort :)

I'm not sure. Maybe requiring prompts is not the best way to go about it,
it may be a lot of annoyance to go back through your conversations and
see what prompts were relevant. I do think the prompts still likely show
whether you understood what you're doing, assuming they were authentic.

Yes, requiring human written commit message sounds like a good idea. Only
leaves the issue of people using LLMs for translate. But I think we could
find a way around that.
