I do.

Nobody disagrees that quality of patches is important, and I also hardly
see anyone seriously saying that the fact that a patch is human-written
or LLM-generated is by itself a good measure of quality. If all you care
is that the code performs as described, we can probably stop this
conversation.

What I think makes the value of the Linux kernel is its contributors. I
want passionate developers who will grow in the community and drive the
kernel forward. I want them to understand what they're doing to
contribute meaningfully to the project, and I want to encourage them to
become reviewers and maintainers. I've long believed that it's the
people who make Linux.

This is ultimately why this discussion saddens me. There is a small
number of very vocal long term maintainers who all of a sudden appear
like they've never really cared about the people making the kernel. That
some show a very strong enthousiasm for LLMs doesn't surprise me. What
does is hearing sudden proposals about AI-assisted reputation ranking
where contributors are called "collateral damage". It's borderline
sickening.

What else are you expecting the newcomer to do when maintainers tell
they won't look at the patches before sashiko is happy ?
