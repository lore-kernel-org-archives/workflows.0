Describe the code coverage implementations and what they share: the
Kconfig options, the COVERAGE_PROFILE annotations, the
/sys/kernel/debug/coverage/ interface, MC/DC measurement, and how they
deal with noinstr code. Point to it from the gcov and KCOV
documentation, and document gcov's MC/DC support.

+=============
+Code coverage
+=============
+
+The kernel can be instrumented to find out which parts of it get executed.
+This serves two different purposes:
+
+* Measuring code coverage, e.g. to assess and improve a test suite, or to
+  show the structural coverage required by safety standards. This is done by
+  one of the code coverage measurement implementations described below.
+
+* Guiding fuzzers. This is done by KCOV, which collects coverage per task;
+  see Documentation/dev-tools/kcov.rst.
+
+All of them are configured in the "Kernel hacking -> Kernel Testing and
+Coverage -> Code coverage" menu, live in ``kernel/coverage/``, and share the
+``/sys/kernel/debug/coverage/`` debugfs directory.
+
+
+Code coverage measurement
+=========================
+
+The implementation is selected by the "Code coverage measurement" choice:
+
+============================  ==============  ================================
+Option                        Compilers       Data
+============================  ==============  ================================
+``CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL``        GCC, Clang      gcov ``.gcda`` files, see
+                                              Documentation/dev-tools/gcov.rst
+``CONFIG_LLVM_COV_KERNEL``    Clang 19 and    LLVM raw profile of the kernel
+                              later           image (``.profraw``)
+============================  ==============  ================================
+
+The instrumentation and the format of the data are defined by the toolchain,
+so only one implementation can be used at a time. Both only instrument C
+code.
+
+Clang's source-based code coverage (``CONFIG_LLVM_COV_KERNEL``) instruments
+the code in the compiler front end. Its data therefore maps back to the source
+code exactly, regardless of the optimizations applied, and it can show the
+coverage of every condition of a decision. It only instruments code built into
+the kernel image. gcov also supports modules.
+
+
+Selecting the code to instrument
+--------------------------------
+
+``CONFIG_COVERAGE_PROFILE_ALL`` instruments the entire kernel. On architectures
+that don't support it, or to instrument only parts of the kernel, add a line
+like the following to the respective Makefile.
+
+For a single file (e.g. main.o)::
+
+	COVERAGE_PROFILE_main.o := y
+
+For all files in one directory::
+
+	COVERAGE_PROFILE := y
+
+To exclude files from being instrumented even when
+``CONFIG_COVERAGE_PROFILE_ALL`` is enabled, use::
+
+	COVERAGE_PROFILE_main.o := n
+
+and::
+
+	COVERAGE_PROFILE := n
+
+The per-file setting takes precedence over the per-directory one, which takes
+precedence over ``CONFIG_COVERAGE_PROFILE_ALL``.
+
+Only exclude code that can't work when instrumented, for example because it
+runs before the kernel is relocated or is copied elsewhere. Code that must not
+be instrumented for correctness reasons, such as the entry code, is annotated
+``noinstr`` instead; see `noinstr`_.
+
+
+Interface
+---------
+
+``/sys/kernel/debug/coverage/`` contains:
+
+``backend``
+	The name of the selected implementation, ``gcov`` or ``llvm``, followed by
+	``mcdc`` when MC/DC is measured.
+
+``reset``
+	Writing to this file resets all coverage data of the selected
+	implementation. It does not affect KCOV.
+
+``gcov``
+	A symlink to ``/sys/kernel/debug/gcov``, where gcov keeps its data (see
+	Documentation/dev-tools/gcov.rst).
+
+``llvm/profraw``
+	The raw profile of the kernel image, for Clang's source-based code
+	coverage.
+
+``kcov``
+	A symlink to ``/sys/kernel/debug/kcov`` (see
+	Documentation/dev-tools/kcov.rst).
+
+The instrumented code updates the coverage data without synchronizing with
+readers, so reading the data while other CPUs execute instrumented code
+doesn't give an atomic snapshot, and the same applies to a reset.
+
+With Clang's source-based code coverage, convert the raw profile and create a
+report with the ``llvm-profdata`` and ``llvm-cov`` tools of the LLVM version
+that built the kernel, since the raw profile format changes between releases::
+
+	# cp /sys/kernel/debug/coverage/llvm/profraw vmlinux.profraw
+	$ llvm-profdata merge vmlinux.profraw -o vmlinux.profdata
+	$ llvm-cov report -instr-profile=vmlinux.profdata vmlinux
+	$ llvm-cov show -instr-profile=vmlinux.profdata vmlinux kernel/fork.c
+
+
+MC/DC
+-----
+
+Modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC) verifies that each condition of a
+boolean decision has been shown to independently affect the outcome of the
+decision. It is required by safety standards such as DO-178C (avionics) and
+ISO 26262 (automotive). Enable it with ``CONFIG_COVERAGE_MCDC``:
+
+* With Clang's source-based code coverage, decisions with more than
+  ``CONFIG_LLVM_COV_MCDC_MAX_CONDITIONS`` conditions are not measured. Show
+  the results with ``llvm-cov show -show-mcdc`` and
+  ``llvm-cov report -show-mcdc-summary``.
+
+* With gcov, GCC 14 or later is required, and decisions with more than 64
+  conditions are not measured. Show the results with ``gcov --conditions``.
+
+Decisions that aren't measured still get branch coverage. To list them, build
+with ``KCFLAGS=-Wpgo-coverage`` (Clang) or
+``KCFLAGS=-Wcoverage-too-many-conditions`` (GCC). Clang only warns about them
+by default before version 22, as it can't disable these warnings.
+
+
+noinstr
+=======
+
+Code annotated ``noinstr`` must not be instrumented; this includes the code
+running on kernel entry and exit, and in NMI context. Outside of
+``instrumentation_begin()``/``instrumentation_end()`` sections, ``noinstr``
+functions may only call other ``noinstr`` functions and ``__always_inline``
+functions.
+
+The code coverage measurement implementations insert their instrumentation
+before functions get inlined, which would carry the instrumentation of an
+``__always_inline`` function into the ``noinstr`` code it is inlined into. To
+avoid that, ``__always_inline`` functions are not instrumented when one of them
+is enabled, and as a consequence they don't show up in the coverage data.
+
+With ``CONFIG_NOINSTR_VALIDATION``, objtool reports coverage counters that get
+updated by ``noinstr`` code outside of such sections.
+
+KCOV instruments the code after inlining and honours ``noinstr`` through the
+``no_sanitize_coverage`` attribute with Clang and GCC 12 or later; with older
+GCC, objtool removes its calls from ``noinstr`` code.

+MC/DC Coverage
+--------------
+
+When using GCC 14 or later with ``CONFIG_COVERAGE_MCDC=y``, Modified
+Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) data is collected alongside standard
+branch coverage. MC/DC verifies that each condition in a decision
+independently affects the decision's outcome.
+
+To view MC/DC data, use::
+
+    gcov --conditions -o /sys/kernel/debug/gcov/path/to/dir file.c
+
+MC/DC coverage is required by safety standards such as DO-178C
+(avionics) and ISO 26262 (automotive).
+
+GCC's condition coverage implementation has a limit of 64 conditions per
+boolean expression, due to the use of 64-bit bitmasks internally.
+Expressions exceeding this limit cannot be instrumented and will produce
+a compiler warning. This does not affect the correctness of the kernel;
+those expressions simply will not have MC/DC coverage data.
+
+Note that MC/DC instrumentation increases binary size and execution
+overhead compared to standard gcov profiling.
+
