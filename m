I don't think it can work that easily as the signed content is not just
the message.
It would need git to support nesting signatures and to allow amending a
commit without
touching the signature and to allow adding one to cover the new content
and to have a
way to verify every step.
Moreover you won't be able to reparent the commit as a maintainer (wich
I think is
also a deal-breaker)
