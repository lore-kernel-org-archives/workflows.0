I do not have a problem with coding-assistants.rst staying as it is
now. But it does not make for a good agents.md file. And neither does
the readme.

If the user asks an agent how should I use LLM assistance when
contributing to the kernel, then the agent will find this file
correctly and explain the basics to the user. So it works as it is
supposed to already.

I do not disagree or proposed something different. Agents can read
docs just fine (rst, html, they can even read assembly code assembled
just fine), and the existing kernel docs are fine for that. But they
should only read them when they want to or when they are asked to. I
did not propose rewriting the docs for agents.

I think there might be a misunderstanding with what an agents.md file
is meant to do. It is meant to be a small file that lists a few
notable things agents should know about a project. For example, see
[1][2] I made recently while working on two projects. Most projects
are limited in scope, and most teams use the same LLM agents more or
less, so it is easy to make a universal agents.md file that is then
extended lightly (but mostly not) by individual members.

For the kernel, this is harder to do because how people use the kernel
varies a lot. Therefore, people should make their own agents.md file.
Just like we make our own deployment scripts, our own debugging
scripts, our own patch preparation tools, and set up our own email
client with custom routing rules (which takes multiple weeks to get
right, far more than typing out a 50 line md file). Why should the
kernel make an exception here and say no, this is the agents.md file
you get and if you don't like it, go figure out how to override it
with your harness? If the kernel should provide documentation relating
to how to make an agents.md file with example snippets, this is ok,
and mirrors how other components such as checkpatch.pl are provided.

An agents.md file is essentially the list of 5-10 things you do not
want to have to re-explain to the agent every time. That's it.

Yes last year, RAG, context optimization, memory techniques etc etc
were all the rage, but after the labs started RLing the agents
aggressively and doing scaled rollouts in VMs all of that has gone
away. Agents are now designed to discover a codebase in 10-30 seconds
fresh in every chat, without advanced memory management, do what was
asked, test it, lint it, and deliver a result.

And modern agents will also write kernel code and compile it and use
checkpatch and deploy it and write synthetic throwaway tests and
enable debug fs and sync a partial module so they do not have to
reboot a device and read /dev/mem directly while creating a kernel
module without being asked to or with a special AGENTS.md file.

Yesterday/today, I made a USB C controller driver [3] for example and
it works... Then a Zotac Zone user appeared so I wrote a hwmon driver
[4] in 5 minutes while the other agents were proding the battery and
type c of the samsung device (yes, there is also a battery driver).
And the thing with [4] if you look at it is... it is clean in an
upstreamable state and only took 4 back and forths... 1 month ago, I
was annoyed I could not use my 8bitdo controller outside so I just
ported the SDL protocol from SDL to the kernel enabling IMU and back
buttons outside of it and Steam [6]. Again 20 minutes. Of course, DCO
needs care with both [4] and [5], so you see for example [5] says
"GPL-2.0-only AND Zlib" because it is a mechanic (LLM) conversion from
SDL and [4] clearly lists and credits the source on the preamble but
sheds copyright because only registers were referenced. An agent.md
can't fix that. I had to write those comments and specify those.

But in those, I did not use an agents.md file at all. Therefore, to
come back to the original discussion, what is the point of creating a
shared agents.md file? Is it to help experienced kernel developers?
Because it won't because they do not need one. And if they do, they
can spend an hour and write one with their particulars. If it is to
help new contributors, that's fair, but without an optional agents.md
standard, how do you prevent getting in experienced kernel developer's
way? And also, how does that agents.md file help those new
contributors? Because omitting sign-offs is not helpful, they will
need to add one even if they do not understand what it is, and the
problem is they do not understand what it is and telling the agent to
skip it does not solve that.

As I said, both [4] and [5] are derivatives and needed special care in
the copyright and top text. If I was not careful and added my sign-off
without the preambles, it would be a copyright
violation/misattribution. But I had to add that myself, the agent did
not do it, and me adding my sign-off manually after that would fix
nothing.

Best,
Antheas
