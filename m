CC: workflows

I'm a bit confused. I understand that we don't want to automatically
send all bugzilla reports to the ML. But AFAIU this is to avoid spamming
the list / messing with people's existing BZ workflow.
If you pre-triage the problem and decide to forward it to the list -
whether you do it with buzbot + regzbot or manual + regzbot is moot.

The bugbot can be enabled per BZ entry (AFAIU), so you can flip it
individually for the thread you want to report. It should flush that 
BZ to the list. At which point you can follow your normal ML regression
process.

Where did I go off the rails?
