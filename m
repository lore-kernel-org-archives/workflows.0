Unfortunately there's a lot of people who have bad motives or feel there's
prestige in kernel commits and are willing to cheat their way to it, or are
pressured by their workplace, or etc. etc.

So I think this is far too idealistic. I've seen too much undisclosed AI being
submitted and those people stridently denying they used it when it's brought up.

So I think tags are really useful to push back against those who are in good
faith.

And for those who submit it dishonestly, I personally believe _reasonable_ and
_strong_ evidence to believe it's generated should be enough to reject.

But there's not universal agreement on that, unfortunately, which makes it
politically difficult.

I think honestly the only solution long-term will not even be to reject like
this but rather we'll have to basically restrict newcomers to a very narrow band
of submissions and have them build trust before they can send more.

Which really, really sucks but I don't see how we can keep the kernel alive any
other way when the slop really ramps up.
