I think it's helpful to point to guidelines, and I've actively used that in
practice with the recent wave of AI slop in mm.

But yes it quickly becomes very politically difficult if somebody adamently lies
about that, and as you know I've found myself in that situation too :)

However, there are those who _do_ attribute, especially those working at tech
companies that are encouraging LLM-usage, and others who are in good faith, so
having the tag is, I think, helpful.

It also strengthens the case for those who are dishonest if we do at some point
institute a 'well this seems very likely to be so sorry no' approach in mm at
least.

I agree we should have the ability to do this.

But the amount of time wasted on AI slop is already too much and we're only at
the start of this, we really need a very low effort way to filter it.

Tags with more information WILL help IMO, but I honestly think, in the long run,
we're simply going to have to deprioritise patches from newcomers that do more
than small changes.

Other open source communities are ahead of us in this and that seems to be the
road being taken often (e.g. [0]).

Cheers, Lorenzo
