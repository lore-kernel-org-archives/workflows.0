Where's the job board for this. Or if you know of some developers that
want to come to a farm and work on RiscV-linux farm robots I can provide
food, housing, and whatever my experience is worth.

Those newcomers need viable paths for employment, at least in the
current system. I think if AI companies want to maintain their sky-high
stock valuations, there will have to use some of that theoretical market
cap by actually committed to resolving and paying off technical debt.

What if we had a "pay-per-patch" model? Would this help or would it just
turn into a game where whomever has the most money gets their patches 
reviewed?
