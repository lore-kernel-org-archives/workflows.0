Can I offer a slightly different perspective here?  I am not one of the
people who has said such things about LLM reviews, but I perhaps
understand at least part of where they are coming from.  It's not "being
exposed" to reviews that is demeaning, it is being forced to justify
one's work to a machine.

I can see how that might feel an awful lot like convincing the
customer-service bot that yes, you *have* tried rebooting your router
and you should be connected to a human without having to do it again.
*That* can be demeaning.

The netdev folks are currently setting up this policy:

	Patch authors are expected to proactively look into the
        AI-generated reviews and handle such feedback as any other kind
        of review: either debate it or address it. In both cases a reply
        on the mailing list is expected.
        (https://lore.kernel.org/all/83360de7addb13a3b5f4d5e722148f248fdb2ae0.1784884817.git.pabeni@redhat.com/)

Without taking a position on whether this view is correct, I can
certainly see why some people would balk at the idea of being forced to
"debate" a machine before having their work considered.
