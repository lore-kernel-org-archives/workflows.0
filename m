I made arguments as to why I felt tags were useful, linking to actual series,
etc. and I feel it'd be healthier if you would respond to those points rather
than vox populi.

But I guess the ship has sailed.

There's been about 1,000 Assisted-by tags since this doc was introduced at the
end of December 2025, which is small (~2% of all patches) and clearly majorly
underestimates the actual numbers, so 'it already happens in practice' seems a
bit... inaccurate?

I also think there's a lot more frustration in 'it does nothing to prevent the
flood of unacked AI slop' in the responses here, which is totally
understandable.

But I think people are missing the fact it makes it easier to deal with those
instances where people do ack it.

It's imperfect, it shouldn't advertise models, but it's still got actual use. If
you were looking for 'do people have a use for this', then yes, we do.

I don't understand that at all. The coding assistants document is not being
deleted, and if you read https://docs.kernel.org/process/generated-content.html
you can see it doesn't enforce tags.

It makes reasonable points that from the sounds of it you don't disagree with?
So why on earth wouldn't we link the two?

Thanks, Lorenzo
