I'm happy with this change, but I'd disambiguate the title a bit. With b4, we
started providing both a base-commit and base-tree footer, specifically
because often times the "base-commit:" line by itself is not sufficient.

Imagine this scenario: a developer is working on some code in a feature branch
and come across a pre-existing bug. They create a fork off of their feature
branch to fix the bug and send it in. In this situation, the "base-commit"
footer would be meaningless, because it references some transient commit-id in
their feature branch. In an ideal scenario, the developer would rebase that
bugfix branch on a known tag, but that doesn't always happen.

This observation doesn't really preclude this patch from being accepted, I'm
just recording my own experience that, by itself, base-commit is often
insufficient.
