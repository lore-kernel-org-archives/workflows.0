The document has grown incrementally over time and new rules were added
where they fit at the moment, each time trying to minimize the affected
context in order to ease reviews, resulting in information being spread
over several sections (e.g. the rules about when to Cc the security team
appear in three different places), which makes it hard to follow for
reporters and hard to update. Moreover it probably encourages reporters
to stop reading once they think they found the information they were
looking for.

This patch attempts to reorganize the document to make it both easier to
discover, and to ease future updates. It only moves existing paragraphs,
without changing the wording:
  - we now start with what qualifies as a security bug (important to
    permit the user to stop reading if sufficient);
  - report preparation is now more natural, with responsible use of AI
    just after "preparing your report".
  - "identifying contacts" was split into 1) finding the maintainers,
    and 2) when to Cc the security team, with a part of what was earlier
    in "sending the report" about the Cc rules.
  - the "one message per issue" paragraph was moved to "Sending the
    report";
  - a new section "after sending the report" covers the parapgraph
    about a reporter's expected availability in a more visible way,
    and could later receive parts related to coordinated disclosure
    if relevant.

Using "git show --color-moved=dimmed-zebra" helps here, and shows that
aside section titles, nothing was added nor removed.

+What qualifies as a security bug
+--------------------------------

+It is important that most bugs are handled publicly so as to involve the widest

+Documentation/process/threat-model.rst, and ought to have been sent through
+the normal channels described in Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-issues.rst
+instead.
+
+The security list exists for urgent bugs that grant an attacker a capability
+they are not supposed to have on a correctly configured production system, and
+can be easily exploited, representing an imminent threat to many users.  Before
+reporting, consider whether the issue actually crosses a trust boundary on such

+
+**If you resorted to AI assistance to identify a bug, you must treat it as
+public**. While you may have valid reasons to believe it is not, the security
+team's experience shows that bugs discovered this way systematically surface

+case, do not publicly share a reproducer, as this could cause unintended harm;
+just mention that one is available and maintainers might ask for it privately

+
+If you are unsure whether an issue qualifies, err on the side of reporting
+privately: the security team would rather triage a borderline report than miss

-
-If you're sending a report for issues affecting multiple parts in the kernel,

-One difficulty for most first-time reporters is to figure the right list of

-are essentially a bit more noise for that person, i.e. nothing dramatic.  As
