There's no common MEMORY.md. Claude Code keeps one per checkout under
~/.claude, Codex keeps a single one for all projects that it builds from past
sessions when its memories feature is enabled, and Gemini saves memories into
~/.gemini/GEMINI.md. All of these live in the user's home directory, so there's
nothing we can ship in the tree. AGENTS.md is the in-tree file most agents
read.
