Your email Craig neatly encapsulates just some of the practical and 
ongoing applications of the kernel code in question - I don't think this 
is in dispute.

What's pertinent is if we as the ham/amatuer radio community can agree 
on whether in tree, out of tree modules, or a userspace device driver 
approach make the most sense.  If we are to keep code in the kernel in 
any form, we as a community need to find someone(s) that have the skills 
and bandwidth to keep the in tree code up to date.

I don't think this would be onerous and I have a couple of people in 
mind to nudge who may be happy to do so if that proves the right way 
forward.  At a pinch I could do it, but that'll mean a lot of catching 
up. But I think it reasonable that the responsibility here falls to 
folks that are closer to the code in question than the wider and 
overworked kernel maintainer community.

That said, I think Dan Cross (KZ2X) earlier email makes a pretty strong 
case for moving out of the kernel while still providing a way to have 
backward compatibility, perhaps this might be the way forward?

In any case, done well, this approach would not kill the apps or force 
anything like switching to Windows! :) Great projects like digipi would 
be able to continue with minimal changes.

I wonder if a separate thread in linux-hams makes sense to discuss the 
various longer term approaches to maintaining these capabilities - I'll 
try make time later today to kick one off - such deliberations will be 
of less interest to the broader LKML and other lists.
