Oh no doubt they have highly dubious value as _data_.

But they are useful for practical purposes :) i.e. 'ok I can talk about the
LLM-ness here without it being quite so aggressive to do so because it's
admitted'.

And also political value in that 'here is how you are supposed to do it'
vs. <how you did it>.

I think there's definite practical human stuff that they provide sufficient for
there to be value here, and I've found that in practice also :)

(Though of course it's far far from resolving how we deal with the unattributed
stuff, which remains an ongoing issue!)
