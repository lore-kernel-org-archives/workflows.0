We'll miss all the contributors who started small and put time and
effort in learning. I'm pretty sure that's a majority of the people on
the CC list, and it certainly includes myself. Making it much more
difficult for true hackers to contribute to the kernel, including by
requiring paying for travel to conferences, is the kind of policy that
would make me stop contributing to the kernel.

How many people with very little history of kernel contributions has the
LF funded ?

Time won't buy you a ticket to LPC.
