Why would you take information _away_ from maintainers?

You're making every LLM 'accusation' a risk for a maintainer because you might
get the 'how dare you accuse me of using an LLM rah rah rah' response.

Why not eliminate that in at least some cases?

I continue to be baffled at people's opposition adding a single line to emails,
or a single little comment on the end of it.

I do agree with Vlasta that we need to have a clearer way to just say no (TM) if
we strongly suspect an LLM.

I had a very unpleasant experience dealing with blowback for doing that in a
_very_ blatant case and I'd rather not repeat it if it's at all possible.
