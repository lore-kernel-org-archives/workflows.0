I think the tag did have a genuine purpose for a while. Now we have just
decided to implicitly attach it to every new submitter (because
basically that is the case.) The point was that a patch that was
obviously LLM generated could be rejected for not carrying the tag, and
a patch that carried the tag could be asked to explain further (if they
had not done so.) Or at least, that is how I felt and have understood
Greg, for instance :)

Essentially, the way I read it, is that Linus said we don't need this
roundabout way because we can just reject effortless LLM generated
patches outright. This is good and an improvement.

What do you think about requiring people to explain how they used an LLM
for code generation? I don't care if someone uses it for review, or
brainstorming, or whatever, and I have never understood the tag to be
required for that. But if the code is LLM generated, it would be nice to
know for instance what prompts you used. We should have some way to not
devolve into the maze that Jonathan Corbet has sketched, where no one
really knows what's going on.

Best,
Jori.
