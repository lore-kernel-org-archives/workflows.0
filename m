I agree that it should not be built on top of email. I believe that the
requirement people are asking for, is that email is integrated in it.

For example, I love bugzilla's that are set up where I can be emailed
when someone submits a report. And I can reply via email to that email
I received, and my reply goes into bugzilla.

The one that submitted the report doesn't need to have email for it.
They can submit via the bugzilla interface, and even see my reply. But
bugzilla is not built on top of email in this regard, but it can nicely
interact with it.

I believe that's what people are asking about. That email is one of the
interfaces to whatever tool we come up with.
