It *is* possible to make a deterministic LLM, and this is why I think it
is critical to my personal future to have an LLM that can actually be
understood by a human instead of a random number generator casino that
sometimes puts "4" in your private key.

What this means for this discussion is a clear process and social
expectation on the core OS kernel development community that humans who
use this kind of technology for an open source project make a machine-
readable note in the commit message on what proprietary tools have been
used.

"Assisted by: Claude"
"Assisted by: GNU/LLM/Linux"
"Assisted by: <redacted>"
"Assisted by: Debian"

All of these tags say way more than a simple binary flag for "LLM was
used".

If you don't agree with me, that's your choice as an individual. I also
want to point out that it seems like many of the biggest LLM users are
also being funded by large organizations that have well-developed and
important *policy* about both inbound GPL contamination issues, as well
as outbound.

How many maintainers on this list that use LLMs have asked their legal
departments about the risks of including code that does not have settled
case law on copyright? 

How much money would it cost to rip out and clean-room a bunch of code
without the benefit of *any* AI or LLM?

If we are going to solve this problem, my view is we are going to have
to look at how to fund maintainers in a more organized way. If LLM
codegen tools are causing a lot of "noise", then maybe we should explore
how to bill the noise generators.
