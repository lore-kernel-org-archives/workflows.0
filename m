This is why I'd like to know *which* LLM I'm dealing with, so at least
if the human is not paying attention, maybe the LLM developers will care
enough to provision a large enough context window to actually retain the
critique.

Automated-by: LLM ( env: LPttYC3GoXNrBqGfLT7tTbNHm8SiUpBwYz )

If we're really going to be open to new tools, maybe it's time to start
having one or more linux-llm forks that are entirely maintained by tools
and the only thing the humans are doing is deciding which one to run and
posting prompts like this to the mailing list.

The one I want to be using for farm robots is going to be the version
that has a credible path to including the hash tree of signatures of the
LLM model weights, the Nvidia GPU driver version that ran the tool, and
a cryptocurrency address to fund the tokens needed to run the automation.

In the example above, which is the FSF's Litecoin donation address, all
of this information could be included as transaction metadata associated
with the address.
