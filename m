I haven't really seen anyone opposed the following I wrote earlier:

- it's more relevant to know how an LLM was used than that it was used (and the
  tag is just a quick indication of this)
- advertising for particular corporations does not really serve any purpose to
  the community, so just say "LLM"
- the tags may be used to prevent arguing
- the requirement to be open about LLM use (whether by tags or whatever) makes
  it easier for maintainers (if they feel the need) to de-prioritize patches
  by someone unwilling to abide by these rules whenever the maintainer perceives
  or suspects prior undeclared LLM use. This prevents an asymmetrical situation
  of LLM slop being produced much faster that what can be reviewed.

Perhaps the last point is more controversial.

I would really like to adept the systemd policy text.[1] If I have time later today
I'll try to write something up... although maybe it is too ambitious :)
