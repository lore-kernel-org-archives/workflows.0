Yes.

I'm going to follow netdev and start dropping those tags from the
changelog completely too. After speaking to some bpf maintainers they
also don't use the tag. So I can safely assume that 3 large subsystems
don't bother with it.

So seems to me that such requirements should just move into the
subsystem profiles.

I think as a global policy this has ran its course.

Tbh, I think that's equally pointless. There are also very few instances
of non-AI attribution with Assisted-by.

If the tool mattered to what was done significantly then it should just
be disclosed in an appropriate paragraph in the commit message. The tag
itself is imho equally useless for this. I really don't need to know
that you used grep or git-sed or tcpdump and it certainly doesn't need
to spam the trailers.
