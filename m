Again, that's on the user. Your argument is saying that we should just drop
this whole DCO nonsense because no one understands it anyway.

We can't stop enforcing things just because users don't bother reading the
docs.

Nothing is stopping you from changing this behavior to your liking either, but
at that point it makes you a downstream consumer on the kernel, so you get to
carry that delta.

All I care about is having all these "agents" follow the rules and guidelines
that the kernel community set around LLM contributions. I'm not trying to
improve the quality or make it more efficient. This patch is purely about
having the majority of LLM agents follow our rules out of the box.

If you want to spend a few months trying to massage an AGENTS.md to the liking
of your LLMs-of-choice, then go at it.
