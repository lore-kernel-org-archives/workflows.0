Food for thought, the Kubernetes project has published a disclosure
policy ([1], reported by LWN.net at [2], with a blog post explaininig it
at [3]). Quoting LWN.net,

"Of note, the project requires disclosure when AI tools have been used
to assist in the creation of a contribution but forbids the use of
listing AI as a co-author or including "assisted-by" or "co-developed"
trailers to attribute work to an LLM tool."

I personally don't see a lot of value in the Assisted-by trailer, but I
would like the submitter to include the information in a place that
doesn't end up in the git commit history (cover letter or below the ---
line).
