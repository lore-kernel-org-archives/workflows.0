If a patchset is sent to multiple mailing lists now Sashiko is using the sup=
erset of
email policies. But in many cases it=E2=80=99s possible to determine the =E2=
=80=9Cmain=E2=80=9D mailing list/subsystem
and prefer it=E2=80=99s configuration. Not always.

This is super interesting. An obvious idea is that the training set is relat=
ively limited,
if we=E2=80=99re talking rust for kernel code. Did you notice any common top=
ics or patterns?
Does it produce more false positives or worse in finding actual bugs in comp=
arison
to the c code?

I personally think that it=E2=80=99s always better to cc some mailing list a=
nd/or maintainers,
so there is a second pair of eyes. I totally agree that replying just to the=
 author is less effective.
Of course, we can add the text you=E2=80=99re proposing, but why not simply c=
onfigure sashiko=20
to cc the mailing list?

Thanks!=
