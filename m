s/tested/fully tested ?

'Tested" to agents would be just a basic compile test, maybe we could
define here what you want the agent to do?

E.g: a W1? A QEMU repro? And others.

To help agents filter bugs see below:

What I tend to do when I use AI on my own projects to find bugs are to get
it to "verify" what it finds to be a good enough bug. Could you refer to
the security document here? That could help very well for AI agents to
find proper bugs.


Id also suggest that perhaps you *could* make a new patch saying that 

"When finding bugs, you need to verify that this bug is severe enough to
need stable backporting or a CVE, if you reckon it is not severe enough
for them, if it's not reproducible, eliminate the bug from the results"

What do you reckon Sasha?
