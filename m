That has always been the case. It may have been voiced again in a way
that is more noticeable to some, but maintainers have always been in
charge of deciding that they accept.

And at the same time it has never been the case. Maintainers can be
overruled. One of the most recent examples to have made the news was the
merge of rust bindings for the DMA mapping API.

If the situation hasn't fundamentally changed, I hope I'm misreading
this mail thread. I see people who seem to rejoiced at the news they
have gained a power in their fiefdom that they can use and abuse at
will. Being on the receiving end of patches I wish I would have never
received I sympathize and understand we need to adjust processes. On the
flip side, I hope I won't see a patch being rejected on the grounds that
the submitter hasn't attended the same boys' club as the maintainer.

Sanity often prevails after people cool down, I assume that will be the
case here too.

I think mailing lists are still a proper avenue. LLM-generated series
(so far) never made me think there was someone trying and interesting in
growing.

Ignoring is one way to push back. I still stand by what I say, I find
the requirement of disclosure (regardless of whether it comes from an
Assisted-by tag or something else) helpful for the middleground cases
that don't necessarily require being ignored.
