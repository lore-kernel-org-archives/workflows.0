Agreed.

But in this case, I suspect that your "Acked-by" trailer will still be
interpreted as an ack of the entire patch in future git logs, rather
than a partial ack and/or a partial review.

IMO, it would be better to clearly specify which specific parts I
reviewed, like "Reviewed-by: foo # for part a". But if there were no
such usage, I would actually think it would be better not to give
any type of trailers.

Yup, therefore, we better suggest that the latter should not give out
any trailers, or explicitly state which parts I have reviewed.

That said, my understanding of these is not as profound as yours.

Thanks.
