Ugh. :-/ Well, as you can see from a quick search like
https://lore.kernel.org/all/?q=%28nq%3A%22noticed+a+regression+report+in+bugzilla.kernel.org%22+f%3Aleemhuis%29+OR+%28nq%3A%22I+notice+a+regression+report+on+Bugzilla%22+f%3Asanjaya%29
we have to deal will bug reports for many different components. So it
would be great if it could be enabled for all products/components, except:

* all components from the product categories "Alternate Trees",
"Backports project", "Documentation", "kernel.org", and "Tools"

* "Bug Tracker", "klibc/kinit", "module-init-tools", and "Spam" from the
product category "Other"

There might be a few more that are obsolete hidden in the other products
categories (like "PS3" in "Platform Specific/Hardware" or "lguest" in
"Virtualization")

Did I say "Ugh" already? Ohh, seems I did. :-/

So how do you suggest to move forward

Ciao, Thorsten
