That's the kind of behaviour that should be easy to detect, and I have
absolutely no issue with sending all those patches to /dev/null. This is
script kiddies behaviour, not the work of someone with good intentions.
Ignoring those patches is not "collateral damage".

We could go a step further. There's also an increase in patches from
newcomers who send a few patches only, with the usual signs of not
understanding what they're doing: code changes that give an eerie
feeling, very large comment to code ratios, and commit messages longer
than the three volumes of Lord of the Rings combined. As far as I
understand, those are also the kind of contributions that many
maintainers in this e-mail thread would like to ignore. Perhaps with an
automated reply to tell that the kernel expects submitters to understand
what they're doing and own their code, as this category is less of an
obvious on-purpose DoS attack.

There's some irony there though. I wouldn't be surprised if the
headlines about kernel maintainers loving LLMs made the flood of patches
even worse, and we now have maintainers essentially saying they don't
want to receive most of the LLM-generated patches.

I'm sure AI companies will disagree with you :-)
