For xfstests-bld links, I'm ok with whichever domain Ted wants.

Not entirely -- for drive-by contributions and obvious bugfixes, a quick
"V: xfstests-bld: kvm-xfstests smoke" / "V: fstests: ./check -g smoke"
run is probably sufficient.

(Insofar as n00bs running ./check isn't sufficient, but that's something
that fstests needs to solve...)

For nontrivial code tidying, the author really ought to run the whole
test suite.  It's still an open question as to whether xfs tidying
should run the full fuzz suite too, since that increases the runtime
from overnightish to a week.

For /new features/, the developer(s) ought to come up with a testing
plan and run that by the community.  Eventually those will merge into
fstests or ktest or wherever.
