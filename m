I'm already working evenings and weekends to deal with AI slop to the point
of burnout (finished work at 9pm last night, for instance), so I already
feel like I'm collateral damage.

And it's utterly thankless work. You get negativity no matter what you do
with this stuff.

I accept all that, I do it because I care. So you take it on the chin. But
the AI slop wave has changed everything.

What was already an unsustainable review load has now doubled, or tripled,
and there's every reason to believe it's only the beginning.

So now maintainership and review is thankless at an unprecedented scale,
which leads to only one thing - burnout. Possibly even the medical variety,
where you don't come back for a long while, if ever.

The project simply cannot function like this, it can't. And nothing that
requires per-submitter effort scales.

There are people sending 500 patches in 2 hours already, for instance.

The only solution that can possibly work is large-scale ignoring, because
the number of submissions can grow exponentially, and even small
effort-per-submission is vastly beyond available resource.

The alternative is maintainers quitting en masse and the project dies at that
point. So it's a choice between two bad options, but one of them is 'linux
dies'. So the other one seems better.

You're misreading it.

I feel _terrible_ for newcomers. Really. It hurts me that this situation
exists.

I came up as a hobbyist from nowhere. I wrote a book thinking nobody would
care, part-time, while doing a busy non-kernel job.

And the kernel being what it is let me get where I am, for which I'm
eternally grateful.

I want to encourage talented newcomers. They are rare, and are the future
of the kernel.

I explicitly spent time at LPC encouraging newer people, in person, for
instance. I have (often behind the scenes) encouraged young, talented
developers. So in general, I've _actively_ worked on this.

And new people sending small, sensible, non-slopped patches/series will
still most likely get their stuff merged in mm.

So it's very far from the case of 'oh wow now I can just ignore everybody'.
